# EMP-QUERY
📘 SQL Practice – Lesson 1 Completed (Employee Table) ✅

I’ve completed my first structured SQL practice on an Employee (EMP) table, where I worked on:

✔ Creating tables with Primary Key
✔ Inserting multiple records
✔ Writing SELECT queries
✔ Filtering using WHERE, LIKE, IN, AND, OR
✔ Retrieving specific records & conditions

This exercise helped me better understand how employee databases are created, maintained, and queried in real-world scenarios.

Sharing my progress as I continue strengthening my SQL & Database fundamentals.
Learning one query at a time! 🚀
